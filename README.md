Excited to share my firs project in 👨‍💼HR Analytics, a dynamic assignment from MeriSKILL📊

I had the privilege to assist an organization in their quest to enhance employee performance and reduce attrition through the power of HR Analytics.

🔍 I used Excel and Python to create a dynamic HR Analytics dashboard with charts including 👨‍💼 Human Resources, 🔍 Research and 📈 Development, and Sales.

 Here's a glimpse of the insightful metrics we analyzed:

 Employee Count: Providing an overview of the workforce in each department.

 Attrition: Revealing the number of employees who've left the company.

 Attrition Rate: Calculating attrition rates within each department.

 Average Age: Highlighting the average age of employees in each department.

 Average Salary: Identifying the average salary within each department.

 Average Years in the Company: Unveiling the tenure of employees in each department.

But the insights didn't stop there! We delved deeper into attrition specifics:

 Attrition by Gender: Offering insights into gender-specific attrition in each department.

 Attrition by Age & Job Role: Understanding which age groups and job roles are more susceptible to attrition.

 Attrition by Education: Analyzing the link between educational backgrounds and attrition rates.

 Attrition by Job Role: Identifying the roles with higher attrition rates.

 Attrition by Years at Company: Examining how an employee's tenure influences attrition in each department.
